a) R(A,B,C,D,E) has functional dependencies D->B, CE->A
1. The relation R is not in BCNF because the first FD's closure is:
D+ = {D,B}
which is a dependency violation.
2. Thus we decompose R with R1(D,B) and R2(A,C,E,D)
The FD D->B is satisfied and so R1 is in BCNF form.
3. The closure of CE is:
CE+ = {C,E,A} which means this dependency is violated
4. Thus we decompose R2 into R3(C,E,A) and R4(D,C,E)
The FD is satisfied and all relationships are in BCNF form
5. Thus the relations are R1(D,B), R3(C,E,A), and R4(D,C,E)

b) S(A,B,C,D,E) has functional dependencies A->E, BC->A, DE->B
1. The relation S is not in BCNF because the first FD's closure is:
A+ = {A,E}
which is a dependency violation.
2. To resolve it we decompose S into S1(A,E) and S2(B,C,D,A)
The functional dependency BC->A is still violated because
the closure of BC is:
BC+ = {B,C,A}
3. To resolve this we decompose S2 into S3(B,C,A) and S4(D,B,C)
4. The FD BC->A is satisfied and S3 is in BCNF form.
We also notice that DE->B is lost but BCNF still holds 
because for S4 D+ = {D}, B+ = {B}, C+ = {C}
Thus BCNF form of S is S1(A,E), S3(B,C,A), S4(D,B,C)

c) A->A, B->B, C->C, D->D will give all subsets of {A,B,C,D} to be closed.
For this question no FD's will also give this subset.

d) A->BCD, B->ACD, C->ABD, D-> ABC will yield close subsets of {} and {A,B,C,D}

e) A->BCD, B->C, C->B, D->ABC will yield close subsets of {}, {A,B,C,D} and {B,C}
