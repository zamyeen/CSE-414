The cloud-hosted DBMS Microsoft Azure used in this project wasn’t great in my experience. Queries took much longer to run on the cloud and many times there were malfunctions resulting in a log out or unable to respond for some amount of time. However, the DBMS also had a more updated version of SQL running than SQLite where some queries could not run because some commands were not available in SQLite. Additionally some queries simply did not have the algorithmic speed to be solved within any reasonable time - specifically question 5. For fellow students tinkering around I think SQLite and similar local database engines for quick query manipulation. However, with the added benefits of up-to date methods and run-time simplifications for specific large algorithmic heavy queries I would suggest the use of DBMS. I think the difference comes in the differences between the types of database engines, and what they’re more suited for.
